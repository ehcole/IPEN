<b> How to use</b>

First, run python configure.py to set absolute paths to the corresponding output file for each analysis script. Each script can then be run directly.

<b>Note: the scripts 6_pinPowers.py and 6_reactionRates.py each accept a path to an .h5 file as a command line argument so that they can be run on either 3D models or 2D models. All other scripts are designed to be run only for the 3D model.
