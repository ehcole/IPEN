<b>Overview</b>

This experiment analyzes the kinetics parameters of the reactor, as well as the power distribution and reaction rate distributions. 6_beta.py computes the experimental value of beta_effective and lambda and compares them to the experimental value. 6_pinPowers.py compares the power in each pin in the core to the experimental value for that cell. 6_reactionRates.py compares the reaction rate in each pin in the core to the experimental value for that cell.
