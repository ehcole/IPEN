<b>How to use</b>

These scripts are designed to be run from within this directory and contain local paths to pinPowers.py and reactionRates.py, as well as the necessary output files. pinPowers.sh and reactionRates.sh compute the error in pin power prediction and reaction rate prediction respectively across all 6 configurations of buckling values and fine or coarse mesh. In both scripts, the "reference" case refers to the coarse mesh case.
