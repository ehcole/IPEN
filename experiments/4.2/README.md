<b>Overview</b>

This experiment exmaines several critical conditions that differ in control rod position and in concentration of diffused boron and compares them to perturbed cases with the control rods completely removed. The 4-2_reactivity.py script compares the difference in eigenvalues between the critical and perturbed cases to the corresponding experimental differences in eigenvalues of those states.
