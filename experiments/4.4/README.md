<b>Overview</b>

This experiment examines the reactivity effects of a reflector box containing heavy water in one case and light water in the other several different critical configurations defined by control rod positions and compares them to the perturbed case with the control rods removed. 4-4_heavy_reactivity.py and 4-4_light_reactivity.py compares the differences in eigenvalues between pairs of critical and perturbed cases to the differences in experimental eigenvalues for the same configurations.
