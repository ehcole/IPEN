<b>Overview</b>

This experiment examines several critical configurations defined by differing numbers of stainless steel and carbon steel reflector plates and a specific control rod position for each number of plates. Those critical configurations are then compared to the perturbed case with no plates but the same control rod position. 4-3_carbon_reactivity.py and 4-3_stainless_reactivity.py compares the differences in eigenvalue between pairs of critical and perturbed cases to the experimental differences in eigenvalue between those states.
