The main difference between these input files and the base model is the reflector plates on the west face of the core, made of carbon steel in one case and stainless steel in the other. The largest heavy reflector has 32 plates and is modeled in file 4-3-0.inp. Each file is named 4-3-x.inp, where x is roughly the number of reflector plates removed from the 4-3-0 model, divided by 5. E.g., 4-3-1.inp has 27 input files. This is necessary because the reflector plates are only 3mm but the model pin pitch is 1.5cm, so greater precision than this is impossible. 

NOTE: citations for all data in the input files can be found in input 4-3-0.inp in the carbon and stainless steel directories respectively. I.e., citations can be found in 4-3_stainless/4-3-0.inp and 4-3_carbon/4-3-0.inp.
