<b>Overview</b>

This experiment examines the reactivity effect of temperature. A series of critical configurations are examined, defined by tontrol position as a function of temperature given by the equation CP(T) = 57.525 - 0.06884*T + 0.00278*T^2 where T is the temperature in celsius and CP is the control rod position in centimeters removed from the fully inserted position. 5_reactivity.py compares the eigenvalues of the critical configurations to the experimental eigenvalues, calculates the Doppler Reactivity Coefficient compares it to the experimental value.
