<b>How to use</b>

tempCoef.py takes the path to an .h5 file and computes the doppler reactivity coefficient and the percent difference between that value and the experimental value resultant from running the model with those parameters (i.e, fine or coarse mesh, low, medium, or high buckling value). Files should only be compared if they have the same control rod position, i.e., in or out.
